This is a music game generator.

# How to generate

You play first, and you save the data, and the player plays.

# About this generator

This generator is based on my [FriceEngine](https://github.com/icela/FriceEngine), an easy, light game engine.
It doesn't care much about performance, because it's written in pure Kotlin and draw scenes via invoking the Swing/AWT APIs.

The source code is extremely ~~unreadable~~ short.
